<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="modbus-response">
    <p>Node to show response or response length from second output of Modbus Read/Write/Getter nodes in status.</p>
    <p>Show-Max-Register is the border from where the node only shows, how many data are in response array.</p>
    <p>That node is just to get some information and it is not necessary to work with Modbus Read/Write/Getter nodes.</p>
    <p>If the Modbus Read/Write/Getter sends data very quick, don't use this node to much, please.</p>
